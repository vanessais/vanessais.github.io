<h1>A brief analysis for those who are curious.</h1>

<p>Unless you live under a rock, you've likely noticed that the music industry is in the midst of turmoil fueled by FOMO and lovingly sowed by the semblance of a perfect competition.</p>

Pandora. 
Spotify. 
Grooveshark. 
Rdio.
Deezer.
Google Play.
YouTube.
Tidal. 
Apple Music.
Facebook ... ?

And the list goes on.

Player after player has entered the space of music via internet because music is a universally demanded product, and the old music industry's inability to effectively adapt to the internet has left doors wide open for piracy, confusion and general chaos. 

So with everyone running around like a headless chicken ... what's actually going on?

<h2>A brief history</h2>

With the invention of the parlophone came a need for production and distribution of music. Enter the record label. Traditionally, they have had control of about 75% of the music industry, though that number varies depending on the year. The point is they have always been a handful of companies with control over the vst majority of the music industry. 

Today, there are only three left (they have absorbed all the others): Warner Music Group, Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment.

<strong>These are the three companies that control the vast majority of the industry and are doing all they can to keep it.</strong>

<h3>The new guys</h3>

With the internet and the miracle that is peer-to-peer, Napster arose and was a force that grew from zero to almost 15 million monthly unique users in one year. Sued out of existence as the sacrificial lamb to the music industry gods, Napster proved that P2P was a wildly successful model that had the power to effortlessly knock the majors down. 

Napster was shut down. It was a win, but left the majors scarred (and scared). 

Itunes followed, taking advantage of what Napster had revealed&mdash;people love digital music and they want to unbundle albums. And from iTunes came the next revelation: people love to stream music.

This led to the rush of new streaming services that we've seen over the past decade and a half. Today, these all fall into two categories: Interactive and Non-Interactive streaming.

<em>Interactive</em> streaming services those that allow the user to choose the particular song he or she wants to listen to. Spotify, Grooveshark and Rdio are examples of this. Then there are <em>Non-Interactive</em> services, which don't let you explicitly listen to an exact track by choice. Examples of this are Pandora or Setmine.

How's everything working out for everyone? 

Well, it's like a particularly bad version of daytime T.V.&mdash;everyone's in bed with each other and/or trying to kill each other.

<h2>Let's talk about Apple</h2>

Like mentioned above, the music industry is a common topic because music is a ubiquuitous product. However, Apple's bringing it back with its new music service. 

There are a million things to say about Apple music. Are they trying to be too much? Are they approaching the problem in the wrong way? Will they be that force to mainstream music streaming? And what was up with all the Taylor Swift jazz?

Apple's <em>modus operandi</em> has always been to observe, see what works, then make it a million times more sexy and sell it to the mass market. They didn't invent the MP3 player. Or the smartphone. But hey, they might as well have. 

The same goes for Apple Music. There are two kinds of music services&mdash;interactive and non-interactive. Most music services fall into one of these two categories. People generally subscribe to one or the other, not both. So why not take both of these successful models and wrap them into one package that will make everyone happy?

Apple has created something that's everything: radio, automated radio, and on-demand streaming.
