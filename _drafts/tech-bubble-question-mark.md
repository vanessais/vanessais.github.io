There's been a lot of talk about the tech bubble lately. What it means, how it affects everyone and their mother, and whether such a beast actually exists. Well, as someone who's too young to remember the dot com bubble, and works in the tech startup industry, this tech bubble situation is one I've been listening to very closely. I've looked, listened, discussed, and will now discourse for you the conclusions drawn by me, a tech-startup-millennial-skeptic.

<h2>Shh, Marc's talking</h2>
<p>The notion of us being in a tech bubble is not a new one, though the topic has been discussed more recently because of an <a href="http://a16z.com/2015/06/18/marc-primack-conversation/">interview last week between Fortune Magazine's Dan Primack and Andreessen Horowitz's Marc Andreessen</a>. Marc argued there is no tech bubble, but hey, let's all remember that he's a tech VC and it's his <em>job</em> to be calm, cool and in control.</p>

<h1>The case for "Tech Bubble No"</h1>

<p>First, a little tech bubble etymology. The term "unicorn" was first coined by Aileen Lee in 2013 to describe "U.S.-based software companies started since 2003 and valued at over $1 billion by public or private market investors." Which meant, at the time, software companies less than a decade old that were worth a lot of money. Since this, the term has expanded, but is still widely used to describe tech companies with billion-dollar-plus valuations. </p>

<p>At Aileen's time, there were 39 unicorns. Today, there are <strong>more than a hundred</strong> companies that meet "unicorn" criteria, so it's little surprise people are making the argument of the "zebra"&mdash;exotic, but not rare.</p>

<p>In truth, as <a href="http://a16z.com/2015/06/17/a16z-podcast-the-rise-of-the-quasi-ipo/">Benedict Evans of a16z points out</a>, this time it's different, but it's always different. Yes, tech is different now. Tech investors and tech companies are different now, and even though the way everyone's currently behaving parts with tradition, that doesn't mean that history's repeating itself. The market today, after all, is a completely different ecosystem from what it was a decade and a half ago.</p>

<h3>The main thing when arguing against a tech bubble is that today's are real companies with seriously real revenues, and as such, should be taken seriously.</h3>

<p>Peter Thiel believes that <a href="http://a16z.com/2014/10/17/a16z-podcast-the-definite-optimism-of-peter-thiel/">yes, there's a difference here</a>, but this "bubble" isn't really a "bubble" because for a true bubble, the public must be involved to a certain degree. This is a good point, but more on that below. <p>

<p>Andreessen Horowitz argues that this time it's different because of a phenomenon that they describe as the "quasi-IPO." Where 15 years ago a company would have gone public, Marc Andreessen argues, today's billion-dollar-plus companies are remaining private, and instead raising huge late-stage rounds from the private sector. </p>

<p>Look at Spotify for example. In light of Apple Music, Spotify raised a $526M Series G. Daniel Ek, as founder and CEO of a now-$8B-valued company, has a spot on the Forbes list with his name on it. Spotify is privately owned. Spotify (unlike the majority of music companies) has the blessing of the U.S.' major labels. Spotify generates a lot of revenue. Spotify is unprofitable.</p> 

<p>And Spotify is the poster child of a unicorn. Huge growth, millions of users. As far as the public is concerned, and as far as the $1.1B-worth of venture backers Spotify has, Spotify is as good as a golden IPO.</p>

<h1>The case for "Tech Bubble Yes"</h1>

<p>My favorite explanation for the case of a tech bubble can be summed up as FOMO, Fear Of Missing Out. We're in one of the greatest periods of value creation ever, with our "unicorns" either completely disrupting entire industries and monopolizing them, or creating completely new industries and monopolizing <em>those</em>. It's an exciting time, and anyone with internet or software experience and a couple million dollars to throw can get in on the action. Or so the story goes.</p> 

<p>Millennial jargon aside, the case for a tech bubble is a logical one. Yes, this time it's different, and to say that we're reliving 1999 is silly. But at the same time, to say that what we're witnessing now is suustainable is pretty nonsensical, too.</p>

<p>One thing that the Wall Street Journal <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-tech-startups-play-the-numbers-game-1433903883">recently brought up</a> is startups' tendency to play with numbers. Arguably, one of the many reasons that tech companies are staying private longer is that they're not held to the same scrutiny as public companies (*cough, Uber, cough*). As <em>WSJ</em> says, tech startups are using unconventional, non-GAAP (or Generally Accepted Accounting Priciples) terms to describe their growth. Tech unicorns are broadcasting their "bookings" and their "annual recurring revenue" in efforts to grow valuations and gain more funding. And why shouldn't they? After all, late-stage mega rounds are the new IPO. </p>

<p>But what this really means is that tech startups, unicorns not excluded, are inflating their valuations via a private sector that's falling over itself to throw obscene amounts of money at user-heavy, profit-weak companies.</p>

<p>That's not sustainable. Call it whatever you want, but something's gotta give.</p> 

<h1>What it means for me &amp; mine</h1>

<p>So what does it all mean, for my startups, and my friends with startups and my startup friends?</p>

<p><strong>Yes, we're in a bubble. Yes, it's going to pop. But no, it's not's super dangerous, and you'll probably be spared the shrapnel.</strong></p>

<p>This bubble will pop and either kill some unicorns, or critically injure them. The way the tech industry is moving right now is unsustainable, that's established. The behavior exhibited by both rapidly-growing tech startups and eager VCs is reckless, with people on both sides focused on riding the wave. This has to change, but that will probably not happen until some unicorn's shit hits the fan and VCs get burned. </p>

<p>Dear Friends. If you're raising money, raise more and do it soon, but focus on profits. User acquisition is the name of the game right now, and it's king of the non-GAAP figures. Turn a profit, do it quick.</p>

<p>This ideology of "awesome UI/UX leads to big userbase leads to massive valuation and millions and billions of dollars leads to conquering Earth" will likely soon lean back down to focus on traditional, money-generating companies&mdash;because after all, regardless of what's going on in our tech hubs, the market and the guys with the money are still pretty traditional.</p>
