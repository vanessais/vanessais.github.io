I'm on my way to Spain, guys. 

As I write, I'm sprawled out across three airplane seats, and it's 5 a.m. in Madrid. I left Miami at about 10 p.m., and am set to arrive in Spain at noon local time. I'll let you do the math. 

I'm flying Air Europa. So far, I love it. My plane's a 787, the kind that's got like 40 rows with nine people per row. My row, the entire thing, has just me and some hipster kid in round glasses and a horizontally striped shirt six seats away. And Sir Round Glasses and I constitute one of the busiest rows. 

I had two drinks at the bar before hopping on this flight (boarding time was delayed half an hour but takeoff was early, fancy that), I snuck on a fat glass of Merlot in a Pepsi cup and was actually given a free glass of wine just now with my free dinner. Did I mention this was a pretty cheap flight? Hey guys, long live the Spaniards and Air Europa.

But enough of that. While at the bar before departure, I happened upon one very friendly Venezuelan. He started with small talk, ended up telling me that he's on his way to Madrid for three months because his wife and daughter are there. 

"What do you do?" I ask, curious what job this guy's got that will afford him three months of vacation in Spain, easy. I know the answer&mdash;he's an entrepreneur. So what my question really becomes is, <em>what kind</em>.

He's a consultant (His name's Nelson, I find out much later). He specializes in supply chain and links up companies with China. 

Hey, funny. I'm a consultant, too. I do something similar, but for tech startups. Blah, blah, blah.

So we get to talking. My mom's Colombian (hence why he and I get along, the two cultures view each other like something akin to siblings), but my dad's Cuban.

<h3>"Ah," he says, "Cuban. You know, mark my words, in eight years Cuba will be the tech and business hub of the Carribbean."</h3>

Naturally, my ears perk up. It's like the 20oz Shocktop I'd had before never happened. I straighten up, look Nelson in the eyes&mdash;<em>Porque?</em>

<h1>Cuba's parallels to Hong Kong</h1>

<strong>Hong Kong</strong>. I'd love to give you a history lesson, but neither of us are here for that. Learn all you want about Hong Kong, I invite you to <a href="http://wikipedia.org/hong-kong">visit Hong Kong via Wikipedia</a>. 

So. Hong Kong was developed under British rule for almost a century. It just recently came under Chinese rule, in 1997. But even then, it remains almost autonomous: an island of capitalism in a sea of communism. 

Cuba's unique because it's got a government that has been struggling for more than 50 years. The Fidels' communism has served as a beacon to other Latin American movements, but at the end of the day remains unproductive. As someone who has family in Cuba, I can attest to this&mdash;it's a tough time. People work hard, see little. Cuba's economy is practically kept afloat by remittances as more and more of the educated flee the country in search of better standard of living. 

Hong Kong, as a capitalist refuge in China, has seen waves of refugees fleeing first the Chinesse Civil War and then Communism. Cuba, as an entire country will not see a mass wave of immigration for the exact same reason but will likely see an influx of immigration nonetheless&mdash;Latin American businesses looking for an entry to the American market will likely find it not in Miami but in Cuba. 

These conditions will result in an influx of Latin American entrepreneurship in Cuba, and if done correctly (i.e., in tandem with infrastruture growth), we will be seeing exponential growth in our own front yard. Does the U.S. want this? Yes. Will the U.S. help this happen? Well, we'll see.

<h1>How this will happen</h1>

Yes, Cubans haven't worked much for half a decade. Yes, Cuba's been poor as shit for a long time. But despite these factors, it's <strong>extremely important</strong> to keep in mind a couple things: Cubans are almost all literate (something that the rapid adoption of Facebok since its arrival to Cuba in XXXX has definitely noticed), and Cubans are <strong>in the Western hemisphere and thus that much more likely to adopt Western capitalistic culture</strong>. 

An exploration into history reveals that big economies begin as industrialist&mdash;or manufacturing&mdash; economies. 

For the Cuban economy to grow, Cubans must get their new disposable income from somewhere. Why not via the path of least resistance, or companies' easy establishment of manufacturing palnts for Cubans to go populate? With similarly low barriers of entry and NATO, the U.S. was able to take advantage of Mexican labor, do you really not see this happening on a larger, more international scale with Cuba?

With lower barriers to entry and an economy that's so virgin compared to the rest of the world's, how can it possibly be possible that the U.S. will let such a delicious opportunity slip away right under its nose?

<h1>The New Cuba</h1>

I agree with Nelson. There's no way that the U.S. will allow such a giant goody to exist under its nose without doing something about it, aka taking about 90% advantage of it. 

Is this a retrocede to the '50s, when Batista's Cuba was a playground for Americans? When we'd do with Cuba what we pleased?

Maybe. But for now, as far as I'm concerned (and remember, I've got family there that I've been observing throuugh Facebook for the past XX months), Cubans are much too preoccupied with new technologies to care.
