<p>It's summer. And from the FOMO-inducing Coachella Snap story a couple months back to the colorful Bonnaroo pictures consuming Facebook newsfeeds everywhere this past weekend, it's quite conspicuously festival season. </p>

<p>Music festivals' recent growth to a multi-million-dollar industry represents the millennial behavioral shift from a materialistic culture to an experiential one. This has become one of this generation's defining traits&mdash;as opposed to the preceding generation's value on materialism and ownership. </p>

<h2>Why</h2>

<p>The trends come and go. With the rise of electronic music has come electronic music festivals, and with the good comes the bad. Attendees that have died from dehydration and horror stories that have come out of the music festival scene have attached a stigma to festivals, particularly EDM ones. To outsiders, festivals are dangerous. But to insiders, they're a lot more than that. </p>

<p>A music festival is more than event with music. Those who attend music festivals have formed a community with its own jargon, symbols, dress code, and music.</p>

<p>The demographic for music festivals is pretty consistent. Seventeen- to twenty-four-year-olds, but with wildly varying psychographic differences. Skin color matters as little as sexual orientation or age at a music festival, because the atmosphere is of passion for music&medash;which ends up as acceptance (and love) for those there to share that passion. </p>

<p>Music festivals mean freedom to me and my peers. There you'll see this generation's rejection of the materialistic and pursuit of the experiential take different forms. We'll travel hundreds of miles to attend and camp with thousands of other people around, because we're all here for the music and each other. At the end of it, we can't take what that $500 bought us and load it up in the trunks of our cars, but that doesn't matter. Our memorabilia are of a different kind. The younger, high school and college crowd Snapchat their time, and the older, young professional crowd update pictures to their Facebook. </p>

<h2>Brands</h2>

<p>Festivals aren't all created equal, either. Different types of festivals allow for different types of crowds, too. Those who attend Coachella probably won't attend Ultra, and you probably won't see Burning Man attendees at either. The influx of festival-style clothing at country-wide retailers like Forever 21 and H&amp;M just confirms that the movement's made it mainstream, large companies are capitalizing, and multiple psychographics within the 17&ndash;24 demographic are participating in the summer music festival trend. </p>

<p>Music is a ubiquitous part of our lives, and music festivals take this integral part of our lives and turn it into an experience, which music festival attendees don't take lightly. According to Nielsen's 2014 Music Report, attendees spend more than typical music listeners on all forms of music overall (including digital purchases, streaming, other live events, etc.). </p>

<p>This is hardly a secret, though, with digital music purchases dropping and streaming growing but end users still reluctant to actually <em>pay</em> for music. The music industry has started to shift its focus to live events, namely music festivals, because tens of millions of people attend yearly (32 million attended last year, says Nielsen) and each one of them dishes out hundreds of dollars for a single entry ticket. Think: that doesn't count travel, food, boarding or the pre-festival prep trip to Forever 21.</p>

<p>Brands and companies wanting to target the millennial demographic are doing well by doing so through music festivals, though few brands have managed to do it well. Festival attendees want experiences, fun, music and friends&mdash;brands that can seamlessly insert themselves into this goal (read: not overtly market, not sell) are the ones that resonate most with the group. This is difficult to do, though, and few brands actually excel at it. However, the ones that do can make brand evangelists of attendees because millennials are brand-loyal.</p>

<h2>What it all means</h2>

<p>So what does this all mean?</p>

<p>Looking at the past, we can see that electronic music's popularity comes and goes in waves. This might be another wave for the mainstream, just waiting to be thrown back into obscurity by the next generation of pop, alternative and grunge. </p>

<p>And it may be. But that's not a fair claim, since festivals span more than just electronic music, and as people become more connected, the experiential focus is unlikely to go away (at least in the forseeable future). Rather, it's probable that music festivals in the mammoth proportions that we're seeing now are reaching a peak and will wane as new, more niche music festivals with their own unique draws grow in popularity. </p>

<p>For brands, this means getting into the scene now, so as to understand and meld with festival attendees. To do this, brands must get on our level. Interact through social media, have a presence at festivals and events, but in the altruistic way that festival goers expect other festival goers to be. Give out earplugs and bottles of water. Don't push us to give you our email addresses, because that doesn't belong. Remember: add to the experience.</p>

<p>Summer's a great time for brands to grow because it's a time where there are a lot of things going on and people are outside, looking for things to do. Take advantage, because remember, we're the social generation, and we're just looking for new friends.</p>
