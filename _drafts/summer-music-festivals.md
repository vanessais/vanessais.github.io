<p>It's summer. And from the FOMO-inducing Coachella Snap story a couple months back to the colorful Bonnaroo pictures consuming Facebook newsfeeds everywhere this past weekend, it's quite conspicuously festival season. </p>

<p>Music festivals' recent growth to a multi-million-dollar industry represents the millennial behavioral shift from a materialistic culture to an experiential one. This has become one of this generation's defining traits&mdash;as opposed to the preceding generation's value on materialism and ownership. </p>

<h2>Why</h2>

<p>The trends come and go. With the rise of electronic music has come electronic music festivals, and with the good comes the bad. Attendees that have died from dehydration and horror stories that have come out of the music festival scene have attached a stigma to festivals, particularly EDM ones. </p>

<p>But festivals are more than an event with music, and those who attend music festivals have formed a community with its own jargon, symbols, dress code, and music.</p>

<p>The demographic for music festivals is pretty consistent, 17&ndash;24 years old, but the psychographics are diverse. Music festivals here in the U.S. attract people from different backgrounds, ethnicities, races, walks of life. Skin color matters as little as sexual orientation or age at a music festival, because the atmosphere is of passion for music&medash;which ends up meaning love and acceptance for those there to share that passion. </p>

<p>At music festivals, you see this generation's rejection of the materialistic and pursuit of the experiential take different forms. The fact that attendees will travel hundreds of miles to attend, and (as is often the case) camp with thousands of other people around, speaks to the passion for experience. And you see them: the younger, high school and college crowd who Snapchat their fun time for everyone to see, and the older, young professional crowd dancing and updating pictures to the corresponding album on Facebook. </p>

Different types of festivals allow for different types of crowds, too. Those who attend Coachella probably won't attend Ultra, and those who attend Burning Man probably wouldn't make it to either. The influx of festival-style clothing at country-wide retailers like Forever 21 and H&amp;M just confirms that the movement's made it mainstream, large companies are capitalizing, and multiple psychographics within the 17&ndash;24 demographic are participating in the summer music festival trend. 

Music is a ubiquitous part of our lives, and music festivals take this integral part of our lives and turn it into an experience, which music festival attendees don't take lightly. According to Nielsen's 2014 Music Report, attendees spend more than typical music listeners on all forms of music overall (including digital purchases, streaming, other live events, etc.). 

This is hardly a secret, though, with digital music purchases dropping and streaming growing but end users still reluctant to actually <em>pay</em> for music. The music industry has started to shift its focus to live events, namely music festivals, because of millions of people attend yearly (32 million attended last year, says Nielsen) and they dish out hundreds of dollars for a single ticket. 

Brands and companies wanting to target the millennial demographic are doing well by doing so through music festivals, though few brands have managed to do it well. Festival attendees want experiences, fun, music and friends&mdash;brands that can seamlessly insert themselves into this goal (read: not overtly market, not sell) are the ones that resonate most with the group. This is difficult to do, though, and few brands actually excel at it. However, the ones that do can make brand evangelists of attendees because millennials are brand-loyal people.
